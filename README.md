# tweaning
input elapsed/duration percent as x values in the function of a bezier curve
in the range of [0,1] with end points(x,y), (0,0) and (1,1) and get back depending y value(tween),
defining the bezier curve by supplying the two corresponding control points C0(x,y) and C1(x,y).
# or arbitrary bezier curves
-for drawing motion along curves on canvas.
Define 2d array of [ [point0(x,y), control0(x,y)], [point1(x,y), control1(x,y)] ]
Get points (x,y) using parameter t starting at 0 for beginning point and I think 1 for endpoint -should be.
